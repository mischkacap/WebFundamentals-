<p>Journalism and Design Junior at The New School <br/>
Originally from Venezuela. I have been living in NYC for almost two years now, and I completly adore it, although sometimes it does get tough. I love writing, imagining and creating. Trying to find a way to get all I have inside, outside, in a tangible, understandable, shareable form. Words are my main tools, though I am currently exploring photo, design, doodles and any other form. I am loud, and ecstatic. I am happy. I love. Life, things, moments, people, and myself. <p>
